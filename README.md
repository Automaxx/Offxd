## Project Overview

Offxd is a full-stack web application designed to streamline team collaboration. It addresses the need for a centralized platform to manage users, files, messages, and departments, all while providing insightful analytics and timely notifications.  Target users include teams and organizations requiring efficient communication and resource management. Its client-server architecture, leveraging the power of Spring Boot and React, ensures scalability and maintainability.

## Key Features ✨

* **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user login and role-based access control (Admin, Manager, User roles).
* **File Management:**  Upload, download, and organize files within departmental structures.
* **Messaging:**  Internal messaging system for seamless team communication.
* **Department Management:** Create, manage, and assign users to different departments.
* **User Management:**  Add, edit, and remove users, assigning roles and permissions.
* **Analytics Dashboard:**  Monitor key metrics and gain valuable insights into team activity.
* **Notifications:**  Receive real-time updates and alerts.
* **Profile Management:**  Users can manage their own profiles and settings.

## Technology Stack 🛠️

Offxd utilizes a modern technology stack optimized for performance and scalability:

* **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA (assumed), Maven
* **Frontend:** React, React Router, Material UI (MUI), Vite, JavaScript, HTML, npm
* **Database:** SQL (PostgreSQL or MySQL recommended)

Spring Boot provides a robust framework for the backend, while React offers a dynamic and responsive user interface.  MUI enhances the user experience with a polished and consistent design. Vite accelerates development with its fast build times.  Spring Data JPA simplifies database interactions.

## Quick Start 🚀

This section provides a quick overview to get Offxd running.  For detailed instructions, refer to the [Installation & Setup](#installation--setup) section.

1. **Prerequisites:** Java 17+, Node.js, npm, Maven, a SQL database (PostgreSQL or MySQL recommended).
2. **Clone the repository:** `git clone `
3. **Backend Setup:**
   - `cd Offxd/backend`
   - `mvn clean install`
   - `mvn spring-boot:run`
4. **Frontend Setup:**
   - `cd ../frontend`
   - `npm install`
   - `npm start`

## Installation & Setup ⚙️

1. **Database Setup:** Create a new database (PostgreSQL or MySQL) and ensure the necessary tables are created (refer to the `database` directory for schema files –  *Note: This directory is assumed based on typical project structure.*).  Adjust database connection settings in the `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` file *(or equivalent config file)*.

2. **Backend:**
   - Ensure Java 17+ and Maven are installed.
   - Navigate to the `Offxd/backend` directory.
   - Run `mvn clean install` to build the project.
   - Execute `mvn spring-boot:run` to start the backend application.  The default port is 8080; adjust as needed in `application.properties`.

3. **Frontend:**
   - Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
   - Navigate to the `Offxd/frontend` directory.
   - Run `npm install` to install frontend dependencies.
   - Run `npm start` to start the development server.  The default port is 5173 (configurable in `vite.config.js`).

## Usage Examples 💻

**(Example: React Component for displaying a list of users –  *Illustrative, Replace with actual code from repository*)**

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function UserList() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('/api/users')
      .then(res => setUsers(res.data))
      .catch(err => console.error(err));
  }, []);

  return (
    
      {users.map(user => (
        {user.name}
      ))}
    
  );
}

export default UserList;
```

**(Example: Spring Boot Controller for handling user requests – *Illustrative, Replace with actual code from repository*)**

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    @GetMapping
    public List getAllUsers() {
        // ... implementation to fetch users from database ...
    }
}
```

*(More examples would be included here, demonstrating file management, messaging, etc., using actual code snippets from the repository.)*
